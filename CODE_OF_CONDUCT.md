# Contribute code of conduct

In the interest of fostering and open and welcoming environment for contributors and maintainers of the Smart Teddy project. We are committed to the [1995 Netiquette Guidelines](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855) from the IETF RFCs (Request For Comments) communication.

**Why a RFC document from 1995 is that not pre-historic?** Agreed 1995 is more than 25 years ago and that it ages for the end internet. However verbal and non-verbal communication was there before 1995, So therefore communication guidelines are still relevant in the year >2020. In addition to this come that the Netiquette only provide guidelines on digital 'politeness' without constraining inequalities.

## Netiquette personalization

Below you can read re-written Netiquette to personalize the rules for the year 2020:

1. Markdown (*.md) files are fine to use instead of plain acii, however .txt files are fine (See rule 4.2.1)
2. Rules according to NetNews do not apply, since we are not a newsgroup. (See 3.1.3)
3. Smart Teddy is University project and can switches around every quarter, therefore we like to ask you not to flame about administration guidelines. (See 3.2, and 4.2)
so please be flame about guidelines not always be update or refined.
4. Emoji's can be used with smileys to express emotion! If they do not fall out of tone.
5. Rules about e-mails on communication behaviour can also apply to modern equivalents. (for example: WhatsApp, Telegram)

## Open culture 

A supplemental goal of the Code of Conduct is to increase a open culture by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationship between our actions and their effects on our community.

## Regular behaviour 

Please read the [Netiquette](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855) that is simply the regular behaviour.
