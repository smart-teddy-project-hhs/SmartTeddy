# Smart Teddy

With the intention of the Smart Teddy we want to take away worries of caregivers for Seniors with Dementia (SwD). Examples of caregivers are family memembers or medical staff that provide care to the SwD. Because by monitoring the safety of a SwD, they can live home longer without residating in a care home. In order to monitor the person of age we provided a Smart Teddybear and basket.

For motoring the SwD microcontrollers were first choice of implementation, because the provide easy access to low-level motoring sensors. The Smart Teddy and basket both have a microcontoller to have two monitoring points for extra validity. The basket reads the microcontroller basket via a Personal Computer (PC)

Additional information technologies, launching methods, the Smart Teddy project can be found in the README.
